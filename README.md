Playground for git commands
This repo is like a scratchpad for git commands. You can use it to test out different git commands and see how they work.

Commit author should be personal but push may not work.
I'm surprised that I can push to this repo.

Test 001

Test 002

Test 003 logged out and cloned again from another account

Test 004 logged out from github browser account

Test 005 Turned on one more flag under Branch Protection Rules

Test 006 Laptop rebooted

Test 007 Switched to rulesets

Test 008 Rulesets worked with Bypass for adming. Confirm by switching to work account

Test 009 Bypass allowed other user too. Keep the bypass on and log out from the owner account on terminal (not just switch) and then push. It should fail.

Test is that owner should be able to push to main. Anyone else should fail.  
Then test that non-owner can push to a new branch and raise a PR that can only be merged by owner.

Test 010 Bypass setting changed to `Allow for pull requests only`
